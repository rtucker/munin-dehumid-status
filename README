This is a Munin plugin to monitor dehumidifiers.

For more information on how and why one would monitor a dehumidifier:

Also includes getdehumidpercent.py, which parses an rrd file and returns
some basic stats on the dehumidifier in a CGI-callable way.

capacitance_tester.pde is based on an example sketch by Paul Badger,
from http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/CapacitanceMeter
